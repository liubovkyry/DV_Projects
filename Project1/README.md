 # Visualising Flight Delays 

 ## Data

 
I obtained my dataset of Flight delays from The U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) website which tracks the on-time performance of domestic flights operated by large air carriers.
The link to download the dataset is,
https://www.transtats.bts.gov/OT_Delay/OT_DelayCause1.asp

Data has been downloaded for the latest available complete year - 2021. 

After I made some transformations with data I spent considerable time to understand the variables of the dataset and its 
datatypes. There are some questions to explore have been identified:

1) Which month has the greatest number of total airline delays and how does the trend look like for 
the entire year?
2) What are the reasons for flight delay and the most impacting ones?
3) Geolocation plot of most number of arrival delays and the airports which have those delays?
4) What are the carriers that causes most delays when all airports are considered?
5) What are the top 5 airports and carriers contributing for most delays and their relationship?
