 # Visualising Flight Delays 

 ## Data



ABOUT THE DATA 
The data set provided by the U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) which tracks the on-time performance of non-stop domestic flights operated by airline carriers that have at least one percent of total domestic scheduled service passenger revenue and provides summary information on the number of on-time, delayed, canceled and diverted flights. 
The link to download the dataset is: https://www.transtats.bts.gov/OT_Delay/OT_DelayCause1.asp

The BTS data set consists of approximately 19,955 rows with 21 variables. These variables include nominal data like airport and airline unique identifiers, names, city, and state as well as quantitative data such as number of on-time flights and number and length of delays by cause for major airlines by airports. Each row contains the data reported monthly by a specific carrier 6 for a single airport spanning 2021. 

A complete description of the data set dimensions can be found in <i>Appendix A</i>. Only flights arriving <i>more than 15 minutes past their scheduled arrival time</i> are considered late. 
<i>Causes include</i> by carrier, late aircraft, extreme weather, and national aviation system (NAS), which refers to a broad set of conditions, such as nonÂ¬extreme weather conditions, airport operations, heavy traffic volume, and air traffic control.

After I made some transformations with data I spent considerable time to understand the variables of the dataset.

There are some questions to explore have been identified:

1.	Which month has the greatest number of total airline delays and how does the trend look like for the entire year?
2.	What are the reasons for flight delay and the most impacting ones?
3.	Map that displays the most number of arrival delays?
4.	What are the carriers that causes most delays when all airports are considered?
5.	What are the top 5 airports and carriers contributing for most delays and their relationship?
